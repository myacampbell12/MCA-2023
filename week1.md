# **Week 1**

## **Task 2** 

The theme for my dataset is the musical artist Taylor Swift.


## **Task 3**

One challenge to working with music and music-related data is access. Obtaining accurate data can be difficult due to having multiple sources (such as different streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, etc) to gather from, as well as the lack of transparency and accuracy from these sources over figures, sales, and streaming numbers. This can make it difficult to get a proper view of an artist's reach on each platform. This relates to my theme, Taylor Swift, as she has worked with numerous music labels and streaming platforms, making it harder to gather data from all over.

Another challenge is curation. The process of gathering data from those various sources / streaming platforms can be very complex as there are differences in each one of their data formats, privacy concerns, metadata, etc. Therefore gathering and condolidating this data in order to merge differing data can pose a significant challenge. This relates to my theme as Taylor Swift has spanned multiple genres over her career, meaning the data from her music is challenging to present due to her diversity. 

Another challenge is distribution. Mny artists', music is available to stream/listen to on multiple different platforms, as aforementioned. Each one of these platforms' users have different behaviours and listening patterns, therefore it is difficult to fully comprehend an artist's popularity and reach as a whole number as comparing data from different platforms can be troublesome with each platform having their own way of presenting and analysing this data. This relates to my theme as Taylor Swift's music is available for reach on multiple streaming platforms, physical sales, downloadable sales, promotion through social media, and concert ticket sales. Therefore it is a complex process to gather all of this data due to differences in how each of these sources presents and analyses their data. 

Another challenge is ownership of data. Music-related data comes from various different sources such as streaming platforms, social media accounts, record labels, concert venues, etc. Therefore each of these sources may claim ownership over the data they have gathered, which can lead to disagreements and a complex field of ownership rights, which makes data difficult to gather as so many sources control information.

Another challenge is data privacy. There are many concerns over the privacy regulations of user data on streaming platforms as this can restrict the range of data that can be accessed, which then impacts the data availablity and accuracy of said data for use in music-related analysis. This relates to my theme as privacy regulations may restrict avaiability of data relating to Swift's music, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive view of her audience and their data, which could be used for music analytics. 

The current manifestation of my chosen theme, the musical artist Taylor Swift, is gathered from many different sources such as;
- streaming platforms
- sales figures
- social media
- concert ticket revenue
Data related to this theme is curated by organising information from all of these different sources to create a database for analysis. However, this can be quite a complex process due to the reasons I have previously stated.
The presentation of Taylor Swift's music-related data is approached in multiple ways
