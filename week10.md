# Week 10: Audio Similarity and Transcription

## Task 1: Similarity
Here is the visualisation of the similarity matrix

## Task 2: Transcription

This is my original score

This is the updated score after the transcription

Reflecting, I can see that there are many significant changes from the original score and the updated score after the transcription. The updated score is much less accurate than the original one. One change is that the original score has a 4/4 time signature whereas the updated one has a 3/4 time signature, meaning the beats per minute are different for each score. Another change is that the tempo is 102 on the original score, whereas it is 101 on the updated score, therefore the updated score would be played at a slower pace than it should be. On the second line of the score, many notes are missing, which makes the updated score much less accurate after the transcription. A diminuendo on the seventh bar of the original score shows the increase in loudness of the piece, this is where the vice would come in, but the updated score does not have this which shows the song staying the same volume throughout. The transcription of my score has been extremely inaccurate and while the updated score still sounds very similar to the original, crucial notes and pieces of information are missing.
