## Task 4 
Some aspects of my score were not transcribed properly by the OMR engine. Many pieces were comletely missing from the score such as: tie segments, pedal segments, trills, tempo information, and note dots.  We discussed this as this week's group lab as many found that the OMR engine often does not include note dots as they are small and hard to pick up via the scanner, and it sometimes does not include the tempo information as the OMR sometimes struggles to read varying fonts and notation systems. With my score, it was only two note dots that were missing and the others were picked up perfectly.

Some aspects of my score were transcribed into the correct element, but not necessarily in the correct way. For example; it transcribed the hairpin segment from the score onto MuseScore, but it was not extended across the bottom of the entire seventh bar as it should be. One section of the first bar was transcribed completely wrong, missing out note dots and including the wrong staves and beams - however the second and third bars were transcribed perfectly despite all three bars being exactly the same. This relates to what we discussed as a group at this week's group lab, as many found that the OMR engine would transcribe many of the exact same notes differently onto MuseScore, sometimes entirely correct, sometimes slightly wrong, and sometimes entirely wrong. 

Another aspect of my score that the OMR found difficult to transcribe was distinguishing noteheads from staff lines, which messed up some of the pitch of my score as some noteheads were missing and/or in the wrong place. We discussed this at the group lab where we found that in places of certain scores where there was many noteheads close together on the same staff lines, the OMR struggled to transcribe all the notes, which would ofset the pitch greatly.
