## **Week 1**

### **Task 2** 

The theme for my dataset is the musical artist Taylor Swift.


### **Task 3**

One challenge to working with music and music-related data is accessibility to the music.

Another challenge is curation.

Another challenge is distribution.

Another challenge is ownership of data. 

Another challenge is the current effect of AI generated music production on traditional licensing and creation of music. 

The current manifestation of my chosen theme, the music of Taylor Swift, is audio recordings presented through descriptive data presented via most digital music streaming services: for example, Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer. Another manifestation of this music is acoustic data, with Swift's music being available to listen to via vinyl records, CDs, as well as her currently ongoing "Eras Tour" live performances.
