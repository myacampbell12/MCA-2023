## Task 1: Creating a metdata schema
Here are the metadata elements that I chose to use to describe a piece of music:

- <b>composer:</b> the name of the person/people who created the piece of music
- <b>lyricist:</b> the name of the person/people who wrote the lyrics to the piece of music
- <b>encoder:</b> the name of the person/people that encoded the file
- <b>date:</b> the date that the piece of music was released
- <b>genre:</b> the genre of the piece of music
