## A comparison of elements in MusicXML and MEI

### Stem direction
An example of the difference between MusicXML and MEI is the way in which the direction of a stem is represented. 
In MEI, the 'stem direction' element is a child attribute within the 'chord' parent attribute, then after stem direction comes the 'note' which acts as a layer parent element as it contains its own child elements containing further information on the note. The parents and children utilised here exemplify the heirarchy that exists within a notated musical score, showing which attributes are needed to be shown first. In this case, MEI sees stem direction as higher up in the heirarchy than MusicXML does. Using MEI is a much more flexible way of representing notation due to these complex relationships. Whereas in MusicXML, the 'stem direction' element is a child attribute that exists within the 'note' parent attribute. The implication of this difference is that MEI is a more useful form of encoded music notation when anslysing this element as it includes more specific information that is organised in a more systematic way, allowing you to see and therefore edit the notation information much more effectively.
