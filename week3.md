### A comparison of elements in MusicXML and MEI

- One difference between MusicXML and MEI is the way in which the direction of a stem is represented. In MEI, this is shown within the chord tag before any information on that note is given. However in MusicXML, this is shown on its own line within the note tag, and is given last after information on the pitch, step, octave, duration, tie, and voice. The implication of this difference is that MEI is a more useful form of encoded music notation when anslysing this element as it includes more specific information that is organised in a more systematic way, allowing you to see and therefore edit the notation information much more effectively. 

- Another difference between MusicXML and MEI is the ways in which parents and children are used.
