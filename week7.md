# Week 7: Challenges to music curation

## Task 1: Editing my metadata
I added genre classifications and specific licensing data to my MEI file.
It can be accessed [here](WEEK9FINALcopy.mei)

I chose to add these metadata elements as I believe them to be the most important pieces of information when looking at a piece of music. The work that goes into a song with its performer, songwriters, lyricists, producers, genre, and licensing - are all integral to what makes the piece itself. 

## Task 2: Rendering MEI metadata onto an HTML page
The HTML page can be accessed here: [here](metaRAW.html)

Here are ways in which I would format the metadata to make it look nicer:
- I would use CSS to change the font style and size for the title of the song in order to make it stand out from the rest of the metadata. I would do this as the title is the most important piece of information and I would like it to be clearly shown.
- I would also use CSS to put the name of the artist and producers in italics and bold, as thee are what I believe to be the second most important pieces of metadata, and I would like them to stand out from the rest of the metadata.
- I would also ensure the structure of the HTML was formatted in a way that presents the information in an organised, structured, concise way. I would do this to ensure that the metadata was able to be read in a simple way, and because it makes the MEI header look much more organised and vsually appealing.
